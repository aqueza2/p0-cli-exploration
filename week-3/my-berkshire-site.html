<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
- Making a website that looks almost exactly like another website is probably the coolest thing we have done thus far. I loved it. It was very educational. It was tricky at first because we had to watch every little thing we added, otherwise our code would not work.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
- My partner and I knew a good amount of elements that we incorporated on to the site. We didn't have to look up a lot of things. We did look up a few things and google was a good resource for that.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
- I think we did great over all. I really enjoyed it. We knew we weren't supposed to make it look fancy. I think we stuck to the directions well.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
- The good is that it is very systematic. The bad is that if you miss something, like an > somehwere, it won't work, so you have to be very careful with what you write and make sure you've added everything it needs to be functional.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
- I don't have many tricks. I think html becomes easy when you are able to visualize what youre doing. This can only be obtained by actually doing it, so with time I think we will get better at visualizing our websites.
