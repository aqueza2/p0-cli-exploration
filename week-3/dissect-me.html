  <h5>GitHub</h5>
  <p>
    So you're learning to code. One day, when writing something, you decide to do an expirament. "Oh no," you think, "what if I'm wrong? Better save a backup copy," so you make a duplicate of the file and get on with your business. This keeps happening. Before you know it you have a pile of extra files, some with dates and some without, that you have to manually sort through to find revisions. More and more cruft, no matter how naturally organized you are.

  <!-- -What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why? -->
  <!-- -The tags I used in this challenge that I use often are html, body, head, p, and the h1-6 tags. I think I keep using these because they are the main structural components that just about every site on the web uses. -->
  <!-- -How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements? -->
  <!-- -The browser displays the head first and then the body. By creating snippets, you can just type a keyword in and that template of structured tags will appear automaticaly if you hit the tab button. -->
  <!-- -What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist? -->
  <!-- -I learned how to create snippets, and I also learned how to comment in and out a section. I will definitely create more snippets in the future. I need to look at the shortcutfoo section on sublime because I am not as efficient as I could be if I knew more shortcuts.-->
