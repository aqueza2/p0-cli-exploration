/* What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?
The most important thing to remember is that if you do not get the correct path to your css or if you mispell something along the way, your css will not work. I struggled with this when I finished my pairing session and I was not able to figure it out why my css was not working until I finally looked at the spelling and I had missed one letter. One simple mistake can make this whole thing not work.
What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?
The only trick I use now is google. Google has the answers to everything and if you google the right thing about positioning, you'll find your answers there. After having done all these challenges, positioning can be a very tricky thing still if your modifications overlap. I was still not able to get the site exactly 100% as the original website, and we were only off on the spacing.
What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)
I used classes, ocassionally I used tags. I modified sizes, colors, padding, and some inline height adjustments.
Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you chose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
I mostly used classes, since IDs are not preferred. IDs can eventually get us into trouble. I learned to use classes from my peers and from the codeacademy lessons.
When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?
Of course, my version of it had cleaner code. The original website had a lot of things done directly on the html. My site was more organized and it integrated CSS successfully (ie, we didn't have to use the <hr> tag!)
