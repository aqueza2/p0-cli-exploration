 // Manipulating JavaScript Objects

// I worked on this challenge: [by myself, with: ]

// There is a section below where you will write your code.

// DO NOT ALTER THIS OBJECT BY ADDING ANYTHING WITHIN THE CURLY BRACES!
var terah = {
  name: "Terah",
  age: 32,
  height: 66,
  weight: 130,
  hairColor: "brown",
  eyeColor: "brown"
}
// __________________________________________
// Write your code below.

var adam = {
  name: "Adam"
}

terah.spouse = adam
terah.weight = 125
delete terah.eyeColor
adam.spouse = terah

terah.children = new Object
terah.children.carson = {
  name: "Carson"
}
terah.children.carter = {
  name: "Carter"
}
terah.children.colton = {
  name: "Colton"
}
adam.children = terah.children

/*
What tests did you have trouble passing? What did you do to make it pass? Why did that work?
I had trouble passing test # 8 because I couldn't figure out how to make  the terah children property a new object, or maybe I should say that I didn't know what exactly that meant. After reading that and looking in the book I figured it out that I had to do the terah.children = new Object. I thought at first I had to manipulate somehting that had to do with carson.
How difficult was it to add and delete properties outside of the object itself?
It was not very difficult at all. I really liked this exercise because it really made me understand properties more.
What did you learn about manipulating objects in this challenge?
I learned that you can manipulate objects from outside of their original definition. I think it will definitely come in handy when later on when I have to create an instance of an object just for one specific section of my code.
