#### Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

#### Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

 Go to GitHub.com and log in with your username and password. On the upper right hand side there should be an icon with your picture in it. Next to it there is a + sign. Click on it and select new repository.At the very top, select your user name and then write [USERNAME].github.io as the name of your repository. Make it public and select "initialize this repository with a README. Give it an MIT license. Click "Create repository" at the bottom of the page.

 To clone to your computer, go on the select the url on the right hand side of you repository's main page, and copy it. In your terminal, create a new directory that is not inside the phase-0 directory. In this new directory that you have created, type "git clone" and then paste the url one space after the word clone. This will clone the repository you just created to your computer.
#### Describe what open source means.

 Open Source means that anyone and everyone is able to look at the code of a program and can edit it or make changes to it as they desire.

#### What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

 I believe Open Source is great if used for educational purposes. It does not make me feel protective of my code, simply because I know that what I am doing right now is something so primitive that any real programmer out there has already done. I think it all depends on what you are using the code for. It does not feel like a utopia yet because I haven't seen much of it to be blown away by it. Maybe one day when my developer eyes are truly open I will see it as a utopia.

#### Assess the importance of using licenses.

 Licenses are important because when you use them you determine what people can and can't do with your work.What a license does is grant specific permissions for others to use that work. It is important because it protects you as the original author of your work.

#### What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

 Pushing, Pulling, Fetching, and Merging all became solidified concepts in this challenge. I am starting to feel more comfortable with the whole process. I believe soon it will be systematic and second nature.

#### Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
 I did not find any outside resources. I believe that the resources given to us by DBC were sufficient to understand the concepts.
