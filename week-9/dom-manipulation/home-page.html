<!-- Add your reflection here What did you learn about the DOM?
The DOM is a strange land full of mystical creatures. Just kidding. It is a great tool where I can add more functionality to my html text. I thought that what we did was ok considering that we are brand new to this. I thought we could have easily done the changes using CSS, but it was nice to see a new method of implementing the changes we wanted.
What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?
document.getElementById and document.getElementsByTagName as well as document.getElementsByClassName are all handy tools I can use to fetch
the html I want to change.
